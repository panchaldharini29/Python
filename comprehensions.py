"""
Comprehensions in Python provide a concise and efficient way to create new sequences from existing ones. 
They enhance code readability and reduce the need for lengthy loops.
They provide a more "Pythonic" and often more readable alternative to traditional for loops with append() operations, or map() and filter() functions.
